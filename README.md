# Open Source Image Duplicator - Python3

OSID offers a UI (in the form of a webpage) wrapper to dcfldd to assist in duplicating SD cards from a Raspberry Pi.
Originally written in PHP by [Rock & Scissor Enterprises
Limited](https://www.rockandscissor.com/), rewritten in Python by [Aaron
Nguyen](https://github.com/aaronnguyen/osid-python3), slightly fine-tuned by
[JÃ¶rn Nettingsmeier](https://github.com/nettings/osid-python3).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 2 or better
- 32 GB SD Card
- Official Raspberry Pi Touch Display
- Monoprice powered USB hubs (7 ports) (4 total)
- Monoprice SD card readers (26 total, rpi2 will stall on any more)

#### USB3 limitation

If you are considering building a fast USB3 duplicator using the latest
Raspberry Pi 4B, keep in mind that there is a hard limit of 32 devices on
any one USB controller, and that both USB3 ports on the Pi run on the same
controller.
In my case, I was trying to combine two [IcyBox 13-port USB3
hubs](https://icybox.de/en/product.php?id=104), only to find that the system
would recognize at most 17 out of 26 card readers, more or less randomly.
This is due to the fact that the hub consists of several sub-hubs
internally. In the end, I built two Pis with one 13-port hub each, which
works fine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
dcfldd
Python3
Pip3
cherrypy (through pip)
```

### Installation and Deployment

TODO: Just run the setup script

```
sudo python3 setup.py
```

## Manual Installation

### Manual Install

Instructions is for Raspbian since this is designed to be ran on a Raspberry Pi.

Make sure you have python3 and pip3 and dcfldd.

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip dcfldd
```

and the CherryPy library.

```
sudo pip3 install cherrypy
```

Or

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To Do: Create an installation script to do it all.


### Manual Deployment

Navigate to the system folder and create the needed files from the sample files.

```
cd /path_to_folder/osid-python3/system
```

Inside there should be 3 files that we need to setup:

* server.ini
* run_app.sh
* osid.desktop

For now we'll just create those files from the samples.

```
mv server.ini.sample server.ini
mv run_app.sh.sample run_app.sh
mv osid.desktop.sample ~/Desktop/osid.desktop
```

Then proceed to modify those files to match the system paths for the items in those files.

#### server.ini

* ImagePath is the directory holding the .img files that can be used.
* Host is the hostname used for the webpage.
* SocketPort is the port you want to use to dish out the API links.
* Logs is the directory to hold all of your logs.
* SkeletonLocation is where you can find the Skeleton CSS Framework.
	* A Skeleton CSS file is included in www.
	* You can also pull a fresh copy of the [Skeleton-Framework](https://github.com/skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework) and define the location.

#### run_app.sh

* Run app will cd into the system folder, so define the installation path.
* It will then open up chromium-browser and navigate to the hostname and port.
	* So define the url that the browser will use to connect to the main page.

* Alternatively, you can decide to run OSID headless on a networked Raspberry. You can safely uncomment the chromuim line in run_app.sh. Don't forget to set local Raspbery Pi IP on server.ini

#### osid.desktop
* Just make sure the path for the run_app.sh script is defined properly.
* if you use OSID on headless Raspberry, this file is useless.

### Usage

#### Accepted image file
OSID will accept any image file ending with .img name. Other will silently be ignored.

#### Auto discovery of available readers
When refreshing web page (or accessing it), OSID will scan available readers, and after some seconds, will show them on the menu. A sum of all readers is also shown.

## Built With

* [Skeleton-Framework](https://github.com/skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework) - CSS framework used to structure Web UI
* [CherryPy](http://docs.cherrypy.org/en/latest/) - API Library for Python used to manage all actions
* [rockandscissor/OSID](https://github.com/rockandscissor/osid) - Base Project originally written in PHP and Bash
